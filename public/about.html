<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alex Radu
  i am a cook
  I love the kitchen, but it takes up too much of my time. I can't be with my family, I can't go out with my friends because I'm away from home all the time.
  I would like to enter the IT industry because since I was little I was obsessed with computers. I started a web development course and I realize that I really like it. It is difficult even at the beginning but I am sure that I will succeed.
  this is my journey to get rid of my job as a chef and to get serious about web developmnet</p>
